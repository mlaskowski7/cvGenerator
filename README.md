# CV Generator 
My web-based cv generator.
This web-app exports provided data to pdf formatted cv.
BackEnd made in python (Django). Database is held on sqlLite. FrontEnd made in HTML and CSS, no need of JavaScript in this project.
I used pdfkit and wkthmltopdf for pdf creating.
The provided profiles CV data is fictional.
To run the website:
download zip, unpack it and run command python manage.py, while being in project directory, you need to have installed pdfkit and wkhtmltopdf on your device, so the server can work properly
